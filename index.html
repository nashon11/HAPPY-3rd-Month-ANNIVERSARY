      <p>Hey Baby…</p>
      <p>I know I say this a lot—but I really don’t think words will ever do justice to how I feel about you. Like, this thing we have? It’s not just love—it’s a whole damn connection. One of those once-in-a-lifetime things that hits like a calm wave and a storm at the same time. Gentle… but powerful.</p>
      <p>You’ve become my soft place, my safe space, my favorite escape. With you, even silence feels full. Our laughs? They echo longer. Our random little traditions—the ice cream, the receipts, the way you lean into me—those aren’t just moments anymore. They’re parts of me now.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I look at you, and I swear, it feels like the universe paused just to let me realize what I have. A girl who loves me with her whole heart, who sees me even when I’m quiet, who doesn’t just listen but feels me.</p>
      <p>And I know we’ve had our share of weight—life, bills, expectations—but not once did I ever question us. Because I didn’t fall for perfection… I fell for you. For your warmth, your fire, your quiet strength, and even the way you overthink sometimes. I see you, Baby. All of you. And I choose you. Every day. Without a doubt.</p>
      <p>This love… it’s ours. No scripts. No timelines. Just raw, honest, “I got you no matter what” kind of love.</p>
      <p>So here’s to all the little moments we’ve already lived, and the big ones we’re yet to write.</p>
      <p>Here’s to forever, just how we said it—with no pressure, just us being real, vulnerable, and wildly in love.</p>
      <p>I love you in ways you don’t even know yet… but you will.</p>
      <p>Forever’s looking good with you next to me.</p>
