      <p><strong>He is beautiful.</strong> He is beautiful for the way he thinks. He is beautiful for the way he makes others smile even when he is upset deep down. He is beautiful for the way he loves and shows his love. He is beautiful for the way he tries his best in everything. He isn’t beautiful just for something as temporary as looks. He is beautiful, deep down to his soul.</p>

      <p>Your soul's beauty can never be compared. Your aura is illuminating and magnetic and I seem to never get enough of you... Getting to know you was and will always be my favourite memory, and I hope to make more memories with you that I can cherish.</p>

      <p>I'll be honest, you get me really shy and nervous and it might be kinda funny/weird... You’re just too cute and lovely not to be nervous around. I’m always here, waiting for us to talk and yeah, if you ever feel too exhausted to text, we can always call too!</p>
      <p>(Just finding a stupid reason to listen to your voice, hahaha) If something bothers you or if something, let it be the smallest of things bother you, you can always tell me and we can talk just about it till you feel better!</p>

      <div class="divider">~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~</div>

      <p>You’re my moon in the sky, the one who makes everything brighter. Loving you feels as easy as breathing, as natural as the sun rising each morning. You're not just a boy to me; you're my world, my everything. With you, I feel complete, understood, and cherished.</p>
